    The Game of Master Mind is played as follows:
    The computer has four slots containing balls that are red (R), yellow (Y), green (G) or
    blue (B)   For example, the computer might have RGGB (e g , Slot #1 is red, Slots #2 and
    #3 are green, Slot #4 is blue)
    You, the user, are trying to guess the solution  You might, for example, guess YRGB
    When you guess  the  correct  color  for  the  correct  slot, you get a “hit”    If you guess
    a color that exists but  is  in the wrong slot, you get a “pseudo-hit”   For example, the
    guess YRGB has 2 hits and one pseudo hit
    For each guess, you are told the number of hits and pseudo-hits
    Write a method  that, given a guess and a solution,  returns  the number of hits and
    pseudo hits
